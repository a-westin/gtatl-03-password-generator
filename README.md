# Password Generator 

## Installation
No installation is necessary; view the deployed application by clicking on this [link.](https://https://a-westin.github.io/gtatl-03-password-generator/)

## Usage
Users can create a secure, randomly generated password based on their preferences for the following:
* Uppercase letters
* Lowercase letters
* Numbers
* Symbols

Any combination of the parameters may be chosen and the password must also be between 8-128 characters; if users attempt to skip this step, or enter an unaccepted number, it will cause the page to reload and they will need to begin the process again. Similarly, if the user does not select at least one parameter, the page will reload.

#### Credits
In order to get the strings of variables to concatenate properly, I had to look into the .split method, found [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) 

I also looked at [this](https://www.easyprogramming.net/javascript/js_random_password_generator.php) site to help me figure out the for loop.
